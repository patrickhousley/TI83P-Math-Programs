# TI-83 Plus Math Programs <TI-83 Plus Basic App>
This is a set of old basic applications I wrote for my TI-83 Plus while I was in high
school.

### SolveVar
This program solves system of equations with ordered double or triple.

### Distance
This program finds the distance between two points on a coordinate plane. Application also shows the work.

Example Output:

### Midpoint
his program finds the middle of any line on a coordinate plane. Application also shows the work.

Example Output:

### Conics
This program takes the numbers you insert and tells you if they add up to be a circle,
ellipse, hyperbola, or parabola.

### Circle
This program graphs a circle according to this data you in put for one of the following equations:

```
Ax<sup>2</sup> + By<sup>2</sup> + Cx + Dx + E = 0
(x + A)<sup>2</sup> + (y + B)<sup>2</sup> = C
```

Example Output:

### Saver
This is not a math program but apparently I thought it was fun. Not sure what it does now.


The original release of the soure code can be found [here](http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/authors/75/7531.html).
